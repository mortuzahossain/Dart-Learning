# Setup Development Environment
To setup Environment it is better that we use flutter which come with dart along.
Beside this at flutter website there is a breaf discussion how to setup flutter
Then what we have to do just add the dart path at our environment veriable and we are good to go
to run flutter code from terminal.

# Hello World Program using dart
Create a file name hello.dart and put the bellow code in it.
```dart
main(List<String> args) {
  print ("Hello World");
}
```
----------
to run the code using terminal we have navigate to the folder where the source code is in
and then simpilly `dart hello.dart`

# Veriable
In veriable we can use eighter specificly declar using int , float or string or we can also do like 
use var to not tell them what kind of veriable we are using ,it automatically detact it usign the dectared value on the veriable.
more can be learn form the dart [website](https://www.dartlang.org/guides/language/language-tour#variables).
