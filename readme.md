# Setup Development Environment
To setup Environment it is better that we use flutter which come with dart along.
Beside this at flutter website there is a breaf discussion how to setup flutter
Then what we have to do just add the dart path at our environment veriable and we are good to go
to run flutter code from terminal.

# Hello World Program using dart
Create a file name hello.dart and put the bellow code in it.
```dart
main(List<String> args) {
  print ("Hello World");
}
```
----------
to run the code using terminal we have navigate to the folder where the source code is in
and then simpilly `dart hello.dart`

# Veriable
In veriable we can use eighter specificly declar using int , float or string or we can also do like 
use var to not tell them what kind of veriable we are using ,it automatically detact it usign the dectared value on the veriable.
more can be learn form the dart [website](https://www.dartlang.org/guides/language/language-tour#variables).

# Operators
operator are
Mathmatical 
 Addition +
 Subtruction -
 Multiplication *
 Divition /
 Modulus %
Relational
 ```
 ==
 !=
 >
 <
 <=
 >=
 ```
Equality and Relational Operator -> Needed in conditional expression it retuen eighter true or false

Type Test Operator are another kind of operator
 as,is,is!

# Conditions
if , else
look at the conditional.dart file and you will easyly undustant it is like c or java type .

Logical Operator
! , || , &&
not , or , and

is use in the if condition as like as we use it in c programming

# For Loop
```
loop1.dart
loop2.dart
```
# Do While / While Loop
loop3.dart File have the detail

# Switch Case
it is alternative of if although shitch is not available in python but it exist in c , java and other programming language.
look switch.dart to get more details.

# Function
function.dart has all the details, its totally same as java or c

# Scope
Global Veriable , Local Veriable
Same concept as like as other language

# Object Orinted Programming Concept
- Instance veriable (class_intro.dart)
- Add method into class (class1.dart)
- Constructor (class2.dart)
- Syntatic Sogur Constructor (class3.dart)
- Named Constructor (class4.dart)
- Setters and Getters (class5.dart)
- Inheritance (class6.dart)
- Overide Method (class7.dart)
- Inheriting Classes with Constructor (class8.dart)
- parrent Class overide (class9.dart)
- Interfaces and abstruct class (class10.dart)
